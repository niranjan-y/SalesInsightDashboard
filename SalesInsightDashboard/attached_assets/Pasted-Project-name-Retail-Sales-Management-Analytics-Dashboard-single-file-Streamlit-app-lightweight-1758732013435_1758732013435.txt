Project name: Retail Sales Management & Analytics Dashboard (single-file Streamlit app + lightweight supporting files).
Goal: Build a professional, stylish, fully functional retail sales manager + analytics dashboard that runs on Replit FREE without external paid services. Keep everything inside one project so anyone can extend it later.

REQUIREMENTS & CONSTRAINTS
1. Platform compatibility
   - The app must run on Replit Free. Do NOT use paid Replit features or external paid APIs.
   - Provide a .replit file with a run command that works on Replit Free:
       run = "streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT --server.enableCORS false"
   - Provide requirements.txt for Python packages.

2. Project structure
   - app.py (single primary file; modular functions inside it).
   - requirements.txt (at least: streamlit, pandas, plotly, numpy).
   - .replit (run command as above).
   - README.md with run instructions and feature list.
   - A small SQLite file database.db created at runtime.

3. Tech stack
   - Python, sqlite3, pandas, streamlit, plotly.express, numpy.
   - No heavy dependencies.

4. UI & UX design
   - Use Streamlit with st.set_page_config(layout="wide").
   - Sidebar navigation: Dashboard, Manage Data, Reports/Export, Settings.
   - Dashboard shows 4 KPI cards: Total Sales, Monthly Revenue, Total Customers, Best-selling Product.
   - Use Plotly charts: sales trend (line), top products (bar), sales by category (donut), customer demographics (histogram + gender pie).
   - Interactive filters: date range, category, customer.
   - Stylish but simple design: color themes, headers, card-style KPIs.

5. CRUD & live updates
   - Provide Add/Update/Delete forms for Products, Customers, and Sales.
   - Display rows in data tables with inline edit/delete actions.
   - All operations update SQLite and immediately refresh views (use st.session_state or st.experimental_rerun).
   - New records must appear instantly in tables and analytics.

6. Initialization
   - On first run, create tables if they don’t exist.
   - Insert small demo data (5 products, 8 customers, 20 sales).
   - Ensure initialization is idempotent (check before inserting).

7. Analytics & extras
   - KPIs computed from DB.
   - Low-stock alerts in Products table (highlight rows where stock <= threshold).
   - Export filtered reports to CSV.
   - Optional: Simple sales forecast (numpy.polyfit or scikit-learn if available).

8. Code quality
   - Organize app with functions like init_db(), get_products(), add_product(), render_dashboard(), etc.
   - Add helpful comments and clear structure.
   - Mark extension points with # === EXTEND HERE === for easy future updates.

9. Deliverables
   - app.py with the full Streamlit app.
   - requirements.txt listing dependencies.
   - .replit with working run command.
   - README.md with run instructions.
